/*
 * Honestly, this program's description is incomprehensible.
 * It asks you to take input in the form of:
 * 	1. The mass of an artificial sweetener that will kill a mouse.
 * 	2. The mass of said mouse.
 * 	3. The mass of your friend.
 * This program is meant to calculate the number of 350 gram cans
 * of soda containing 0.1% of this artificial sweetener your friend can consume
 * before dying, based on the amount that kills the mouse. This is
 * impossible since we don't know how much of this sweetener is dissapaited
 * through the body, so if we start to calculate this number, if the first
 * can of soda doesn't kill them, it never will, since the mass of the
 * soda will always be far greater than the mass of the sweetener.
