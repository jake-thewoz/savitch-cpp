# savitch-cpp
These are my renditions of the end-of-chapter exercises from Walter Savitch's 'Problem Solving with C++'

There are two main goals of this project:
  1. To learn to use Vim, g++, and Ubuntu in C++ development. All of these programs will be written from Vim and compiled with g++. This is to get me more comfortable with the Vim controls, as well as developing in a CLI terminal.
  2. To refamiliarize myself with C++ and constantly practice, so that the skills and mindset aren't forgotten as easily.
  
I'm including the object files as well as the source code. The object files are the ones without file extensions. Furthermore, the programs are divided into two main sections:
  1. Practice Programs- these are listed as 'practice1.cpp' files, for example. They are less difficult and more instructive.
  2. Programming Projects- these are listed as 'project1.cpp'. These are more difficult and challenging.
  
Some of the programs in the textbook will be missing from my collection. For the most part, this is because they were rendundant for me personally. For example, many of the Practice Programs cover the same topics, but used slightly differently. Because this is an educational venture for me, I want to spend most of my time on the programs that will bring me the most benefit.
